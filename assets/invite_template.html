<h2> Here is what I can do for you:</h2>
<ul style="margin: 5px 0">
    <li >Delete invite links and remove spam messages. 🚫</li>
    <li>Keep a closer eye on new members to ban spammers and trolls faster. 🔎</li>
    <li>Give your staff detailed warnings when users I banned in other servers join yours. ⚠</li>
    <li>Let mods anonymously warn or strike members for breaking the rules.</li>
    <li>Let mods take notes about different members for a later time.</li>
    <li>Keep a detailed history of everyone in your server.</li>
    <li>Log things like bans, unbans, joins, invite links and @everyone mention attempts. 📝</li>
    <li>Send customizable public welcome messages. 👋</li>
    <li>Set up a system for users to suggest changes to the server.  ❓</li>
    <li><strong>Coming Soon:</strong> Allow your mods to talk with people who want to appeal their strikes anonymously. </li>
</ul>
