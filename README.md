Moderation based discord bot written in Typescript using [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)

Currently hosted on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

[Invite Me](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=372615866652557312&permissions=0&scope=bot) - Prefix: $


## Whatcha Got:

### Interaction: üó£Ô∏è

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/414332109407387649.png?v=1)

Hifumi talks to you when she hears you say her name.
- Optional: She responds to every message if you make a channel called 'chat-with-alexa' unless starting your message with a dash
#### Note: This might become very expensive as (if) more people start using her which could eventually make it a donator feature.

She will greet new users in a channel of your choice

### Bans and moderation: üö´

Detecting spammers and automatically muting them for a set amount of time.
* This requires a role called 'muted' that has no permissions other than reading chat and history
* The muted rule must be overriding category permissions
* The channel permissions must either be synched with the category or have its own mute permission

By default she doesn't allow advertising on your server (discord invite links), you can make exceptions or completely enable it.

Locking down guilds on demand, muting everyone for 10 minutes or longer, allowing Admins to sanely take care of situations. **PLANNED:**

### Bookkeeping: üìö

* Logging join and leave times
* Logging user mutes and duration
* Optionally logging deleted and edited messages **PLANNED**
* Warning mods on detecting potential raids **PLANNED:**


## Currently required permissions: ‚ùì
* Read Messages - I mean,
* Send Messages - yeah...
* Manage Messages - deleting spam and invites
* Manage Roles - for adding the 'muted' role to users
* Add Reactions - Hifumi reacts to messages she hears with üëÄ and üëã when greeting new members
* Ban Members - Banning users who post over 5 (later variable) invites, spammers and potentially people sitting in the mute queue
* Change Nickname(?) Could implement a self-name change at some point but I'd ideally like to keep the Hifumi theme
* Manage Nicknames(?) Potential automatic nicknaming of users with offensive names
