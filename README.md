# Alexa 

Moderation based discord bot written in Typescript - inspired by [hotbot](https://github.com/AberrantFox/hotbot)

Currently hosted on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and using [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)

## Whatcha Got:
![convo](https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/128/99/99678.png) 

Alexa responds to everything you say if you say her name.
- Optional: She responds to every message if you make a channel called 'chat-with-alexa' unless starting your message with a dash

Detecting spammers and automatically muting them for a set amount of time. 
* This requires a role called 'muted' that has no permissions other than reading chat and history
* The muted rule must be overriding category permissions
* The channel permissions must either be synched with the category or have its own mute permission

By default she doesn't allow advertising on your server (discord invite links), you can make exceptions or completely enable it.

Logging join and leave times by default on channel 'logs'

Additional greeting on a channel of your choice

## Currently required permissions:
* Read Messages - pretty
* Send Messages - obvious
* Manage Messages - deleting spam and invites
* Manage Roles - for adding the 'muted' role to users
* Add Reactions - Alexa reacts to messages she hears with ðŸ‘€ and ðŸ‘‹ when greeting new members
* Ban Members - Banning users who post over 5 (later variable) invites and potentially people sitting in the mute queue
* Change Nickname(?) Shouldn't really be required unless I add a command for it later
* Manage Nicknames(?) Could add an automatic nick changer later for people whos name matches with blacklisted words or something similar
