# Patch Note Templates

### Purpose

The template is designed to keep track of changes but also offer an easy way
for Hifumi to send it as an announcement in the form of an embed.

### How

Messages are read in from disk based on the latest current one (so file naming is important)
and sent as the body of the message. Meaning that any formatting that is valid inside a message
description is fine.
