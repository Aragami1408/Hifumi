**Completely revamped how commands are structured**
Permissions are now checked before command validity which means Hifumi won't bait you into thinking you have permissions to use commands you typed wrong. Also added aliases.

**$whatanime, $character, $clapify, $cat, $flip, $kick, $ban, $softban and $spamfilter commands added**

**Removed all economy commands**

**No longer responding to the word "hifumi" to chat and listening for @Hifumi instead.**
This is largely because it gets very annoying to have any sort of conversation about her without her constantly replying. Also because the chat feature will eventually be replaced with a command that generates messages that sound like specific users (or the actual character of Hifumi) and also that chat is expensive to pay for.

**$anime now gives WAY better results**
The anime command now uses MAL's API along with AniList's to give much better results for searches. You won't be be getting **Attack on Titan** for searching **K-On** anymore

**No more links in macros!**
Links to images in macros will automatically be sent as an attachment and removed from the message now

**Bugfixes:**
    - **$suggestions** now slides suggestions properly again
    - Logs won't blindly take the first audit log it sees
